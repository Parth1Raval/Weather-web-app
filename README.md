# 🌤️ Weather Analytics Dashboard

A modern, full-stack weather application that goes beyond basic forecasts to provide personalized weather insights and actionable recommendations.

## ✨ What Makes This Special

Unlike typical weather apps that just show temperature and conditions, this dashboard tells you **how the weather affects YOUR life**. Get personalized advice on what to wear, when to exercise, health alerts for extreme conditions, and optimal timing for outdoor activities.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data** - Accurate weather information for any city worldwide using OpenWeather API
- **Personalized Impact Analysis** - Smart recommendations for clothing, activities, and health based on current conditions
- **Dynamic Weather Backgrounds** - Immersive visuals that change with weather (rain animations, snow effects, sunny gradients)
- **5-Day Forecast** - Interactive charts showing temperature trends and predictions
- **Hourly Predictions** - Next 12 hours weather breakdown
- **Weather Comparison** - See how today's weather differs from yesterday with percentage changes
- **Best Time Recommendations** - Optimal hours for walking, exercise, dining, photography, and more
- **Detailed Metrics** - Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, UV index, dew point
- **File Management** - Upload and download weather reports using AWS S3 integration
- **Fully Responsive** - Perfect experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS, Chart.js, Axios
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, CORS
**APIs:** OpenWeather API, AWS S3
**Deployment:** Vercel (24/7 uptime)

## 💡 Unique Features

1. **Weather Impact Advisor** - Priority-based alerts (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for health and safety
2. **Activity Scheduler** - Tells you the best times for outdoor activities based on weather
3. **Historical Comparison** - Track weather changes day-by-day with trend indicators
4. **Comfort Level Analysis** - Real-time assessment of weather comfort for productivity and energy levels

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

This isn't just another weather app - it's a personal weather intelligence platform that helps users make informed decisions. Whether you're planning your outfit, scheduling outdoor activities, or managing health conditions affected by weather, this dashboard provides the insights you need.
